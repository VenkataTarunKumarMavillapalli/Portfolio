                    <p class="justified">In my master's program, I completed courses such as Hardware and Software Architectures for Big Data, Data Management and Computer Networks, Data Mining, Statistical analysis of data, Big Data Theory and Ethics, Business Intelligence, Critical Epistemology of Social Sciences: Digital Methods and Big Data, and Macroeconomical analysis. These courses equipped me with a range of valuable skills and knowledge, such as understanding the intricacies of hardware and software architectures for handling large datasets, mastering data management techniques and computer networks, employing statistical methods for data analysis, and developing a strong foundation in data mining and business intelligence. Additionally, the exploration of critical epistemology in social sciences alongside the ethical considerations in big data provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the broader implications of my work. I learned to apply theoretical frameworks to practical scenarios, implement advanced statistical models for insightful data analysis, and leverage business intelligence tools to extract meaningful insights. These experiences have provided me with a well-rounded skill set that allows me to tackle complex challenges in the realm of big data while considering the ethical dimensions of my work. The integration of macroeconomical analysis further broadened my perspective, enabling me to contextualize and interpret data within the larger economic landscape. This multidisciplinary approach has not only enriched my academic journey but has also prepared me for real-world applications where a holistic understanding of data and its implications is crucial.</p>
