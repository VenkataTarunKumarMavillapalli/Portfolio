            <p>Today the people are getting more and more dependent on machines, from retail to media and from finance to security we have been taking help of machines everywhere. And today with more and more research on Machine Learning they are making our jobs more and more easier even they have started thinking for us. Such is the case with Finance industry, the machines are being used to predict the future of the stocks and they have been doing it far better than the best of investors in the Wall Street.But, sometimes they also fail and people have to pay for their failure. This paper represents a comprehensive review of how the Machine predicted or so called Algorithmic Trading works, its working models and its failure along with its future.</p>
